# Admin-Grid
For this exercise I will re-create an admin dashboard that will serve as an example. This exercise will focus on the use of : grid, SVG, inputs, and all the elements taught in the first course of the "Full Stack JavaScript" path of the "The Odin Project" course. It will contain just HTML and CSS.
